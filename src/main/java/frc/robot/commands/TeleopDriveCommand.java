/**
 * The command that drives the robot in teleop. This is the DEFAULT command of the drivetrain:
 * the scheduler runs it automatically whenever no other command (like an auto routine) is
 * using the drivetrain.
 *
 * <p>This file is also your tour of the COMMAND LIFECYCLE. Every command has four parts, and
 * the scheduler calls them for you:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #initialize()} - runs ONCE when the command starts
 *   <li>{@link #execute()} - runs every 20ms while the command is scheduled
 *   <li>{@link #isFinished()} - checked after each execute(); return true to end
 *   <li>{@link #end(boolean)} - runs ONCE when the command ends or is interrupted
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>All the "driver feel" shaping (deadband, squaring, slew limiting, slow mode) lives here
 * in one place, in plain sight, instead of buried in the subsystem or scattered around the
 * bindings. Tune it in Constants.OperatorConstants.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Simple commands are often written inline these days ({@code drive.run(() -> ...)},
 * see Autos.java for that style). We write this one as a full class because it's the robot's
 * most important command and the class form makes the lifecycle explicit for learning.
